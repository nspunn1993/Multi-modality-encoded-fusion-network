# Multi-modality-encoded-fusion-network
This is the repository includes the 3D fusion inception U-Net model of our paper "Multi-modality encoded fusion with 3D inception U-net and decoder model for brain tumor segmentation". For more details you can refer my paper [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-020-09271-0)

This code requires:
- Tensorflow 1.12.0
- Keras 2.2.4
- Keras contrib
